Chamber pressure and specific impulse of a rocket engine


0. Introduction


When designing a rocket, the rocket engine will be a crucial component. If you choose not to buy an already existing engine, but decide to design your own, you will see that having an efficient engine will be one of your big priorities. Your rocket airframe might be the most aerodynamic, and your aviation controls are perfect, but it would matter if your engine cannot compulse it through space, because your engine works efficiently.


I have come to find this exact problem when as a hobbyist trying to design a rocket and my own liquid fueled rocket engine, getting an efficient rocket engine is crucial. And efficiency in such will often be measured in specific impulse. Now there are alot of things impacting specific impulse which have to be considered when designing an engine. I found that some of them like ambient pressure are constrained anyways so I won't be able to impact them to make my engine more efficient. Others like the fuel choice are often very heavily researched already and have a simple answer, where using hydrogen with oxygen will give a higher specific impulse then kerosine with nitrous oxide for factors clarified below.


But one of the factors which I find hard to follow, is the impact of chamber pressure of a rocket, so the pressure inside the engine before the fuel leaves through the nozzle on specific impulse. Not Knowing what pressure should be inside the engine has haltet my design lately, because the chamber pressure also affects the nozzle ratios and so on… . Through my research I have found numerous nasa articles about optimal chamber pressure, but I haven't been able to visualize the impact or if there is really any myself.


This is why in my IA I will investigate in isolation the impact of chamber pressure on specific impulse.


1. Research Question
What is the impact of air chamber pressure inside a small plastic water bottle as a rocket engine on specific impulse? 


2. Introduction


Chamber pressure:
Chamber pressure is very important in rocketry, and rocket propulsion, the pressure inside the engines chamber will decide how strong the exhaust gases are pushed out. Chamber pressure relates to thermodynamics, fluid dynamics and Newton's 3rd law in physics (2). Chamber pressure is important beyond rocketry, it is important in internal combustion engines, and jet propulsion. Higher pressure gases affect how the rocket engine functions (1). W=PΔV, higher pressures expect more work. The chamber pressures of the Saturn V's (the rocket which flew to the moon) rocket engines was around 7 MPa, whilst the pressure inside the Raptor engines (propelling space x’s star ship) 35 MPa significantly higher.


Impulse:
Impulse is a measure of the total momentum change something has, J=FΔT, in rockets it would be the momentum a rocket engine delivers to start moving(5). Impulse is very important in reference to change in momentum and energy. Impulse is very important in aerospace engineering and spacecraft design, to work on efficiency (3). To have high impulse means that the rocket is stronger which is often seen positive, impulse is also dependent on the time the force is applied (4), but the saturn v engine produced 6,770 kN of thrust at sea level, whilst the raptor engine only produced 2,260 kN of thrust at sea level. This decrease could be due to the higher pressure, but is likely just because a single Saturn V engine was expected to be stronger than one Raptor engine.


Mass flow rate:
Mass flow rate is required for specific impulse, it is not part of the ib syllabus but it is a great measure of how much propellant is exerted from an engine. It ties into fluid dynamics (6), higher mass flow rate means there are more gases exerted in less time. It is very important for any kind of fuel engine, because it gives an estimate of how much fuel is required for the engine (7). Mass flow rate is affected by the viscosity of the liquid, the mass of the liquid, and the area which the mass flows through, in the ocean there is more movement then in a lake.


Specific Impulse:
Specific impulse is a measurement of fuel efficiency, high specific impulse means the rocket is highly efficient, defined as the amount of thrust produced per unit of propellant consumed over time. Essentially, it tells us how effectively a rocket engine uses fuel. The higher the specific impulse, the more efficient the engine is, meaning it can produce more thrust while using less fuel. Expressed in seconds. 


Specific impulse is often affected by the propellant type, what kind of fuel is used in a rocket impacts its efficiency. The engine design is also very important, the size and ratio of the combustion chamber and the ratio to the nozzle affect how efficient the engine will function. The velocity at which the gases exit the nozzle also affect the specific impulse. The temperature of the combustion affects the specific impulse, higher temperatures often lead to higher efficiency (9). And the mass of the exhaust gases also impact the engine efficiency, often lighter particles will be more efficient.


The ambient pressure is also very important, bigger pressure differentials can affect the exhaust flow, so in a vacuum the difference would be infinite, whilst on sea level the ambient pressure is high already. I am investigating this statement, because by increasing the chamber pressure, I will increase the diffrence from chamber pressure to atmospheric pressure. 


The specific impulse of a saturn v engine was 263 seconds whilst a raptor engine had one of 327 seconds, both at sea level (8). Now i hope the increase in efficiency is due to the higher chamber pressure, but the saturn v used less efficient kerosine as a fuel then the methane used by space x, and the velocity of the exhaust gases from the raptor are also higher, and the engine design used by the saturn as a whole was less efficient using a gas generator cycle, instead of a full flow stage cycle.


Nozzle shape:
Nozzle shape of a rocket engine is very important, the width/size/curvature of a nozzle will determine how much fuel can be expelled by limiting it, it also determines what kind of chamber pressures a rocket engine can function in (10). to be expected is that small nozzle sizes will cause higher pressures in an open system, as the gases need to compress to fit through the nozzle. There is a lot of research into nozzle shapes where typically converging diverging nozzles are overall the best, gases are accelerated in the converging part and after reaching mach 1 they get accelerated even more in the diverging part (11). This is very interesting, but in this experiment the nozzle will just be a small hole at the end of a valve. It is important though that it is small, because this might limit the mass flow rate.


Rocketry:
Rocket engines rely significantly on those kinds of variables to reach efficiency. Rocket engines and engines of all kinds are often very inefficient, so the importance of efficiency is highlighted once more (12) (13). Rocketry is very important to us humans in fields like safety but also and more interesting space exploration and fast travel. 


3. Hypothesis


I am predicting that there will be some kind of proportional behaviour between the chamber pressure of a rocket and the impulse of the rocket. Furthermore I will predict that in moderate pressures (all the pressures that I hope to test), the higher pressure will have a linear correlation with higher specific impulse. 


I believe this because of the following correlations which i have found, W∝P, W∝F, F∝J, so P∝J, now considering that the specific impulse can be derived from impulse i predict that higher pressure will also cause more efficient engine. Although higher pressure resulting in efficiency might sound unintuitive as high pressures sound very violent.


Nevertheless I predict a linear direct correlation, which does not converge at all (definitely not in the range of pressures in my experiment).

6. Data Collection


6.1. Raw Data


From my collected data I will show by the use of the example of 50 pumps all my calculations:


First, using the number of Pumps as an independent variable did not satisfy me, instead I measured the volume of the rocket by filling it up with water. 


Vrocket = 250 ± 1 ml


Also the volume added to every pump,  by measuring the displacement of air by pumping air into a cylinder filled with water.


Vper pump = Vfinal measurement - Vinitial measurement = 47.0 ± 0.5 ml - 9.0 ± 0.5 ml = 38 ± 1 ml


V50 = Vrocket + 50 * Vper pump = 250 ± 1 ml + 38 ± 1 ml * 50 = 2150 ± 51ml 


Now I tried finding the amount of moles after 50 pumps.


n50 = nrocket (250 ml of air)+ 50 * nper pump (38 ml of air)


I measured the temperature at the start of the experiment and at the end.


T1 = 23.1 ± 0.1 C
T2 = 23.5 ± 0.1 C
Tavg = (23.1 + 23.5)/2 = 23.3 C


I was unable to measure the density of my local air, but through research I found the expected Mr for my pressure and Temperature, assuming it is constant. I treated researched values as constant and assumed no uncertainties.


Mrair = 0.0290 kgmol⁻


Now assuming PV=nRT i could calculate the pressure, from the initial pressure, i could not measure my local atmospheric pressure, but in my weather app i found the local pressure at the time of my experiment.


n = PV/RT
nrocket = (1.016E+05 pa × 0.000250 ± 0.000001  m³) / (8.31 J/mol⋅K × 296.3 ± 0. 1 K) = 0.01031 mol


nPump = (1.016E+05 Pa × 0.000038 m³) / (8.31 J/mol⋅K × 296.3 ± 0. 1 K) = 0.001567 mol


n50 = 0.010310 mol + 50 * 0.001567 mol = 0.08866 mol


Assuming temp is constant


Patm ∝ R/V, 1.016E+05 ∝ 0.01031 mol / 0.000250 ± 0.000001  m³


P50 = P1 * R/V = 1.016E+05 pa * (0.08866 mol / 0.000250 ± 0.000001  m³) / (0.01031 mol / 0.000250 ± 0.000001  m³) = 8.737E+05 pa


But actually


V50 / Vrocket ∝ n50 / nrocket


So


P50 = Patm * V50 / Vrocket =  1.016E+05 pa * 0.002150 ± 0.000051  m³ / 0.000250 ± 0.000001  m³ = 8.737E+05 pa


%uncertainty(P50) =  (± 1 ml / 250 ml + ± 51 ml / (2150 - 250) m)l * 100 = 3.08%  




Now that I have pressure as my independent variable, I can calculate the impulse. From my measurements I got the time where the peak measurement in the force plate starts and ends so first I took averages of change in time and peak force.
For 50 pump measurements:


Favg peak 50 = (F1 + F2 + F3 + F4 + F5) / 5 = (32 ± 1 N +34 ± 1 N +19 ± 1 N + 22 ± 1 N + 30 ± 1 N) / 5 = 27.4 ± 1 N 


Δtavg 50 = (T2 - T1 + T4 - T3 + T6 - T5 + T8 - T7 + T10 - T9) / 5 = (3.0876 ± 0.0001 s - 3.0298  ± 0.0001 s  +2.2020 ± 0.0001 s - 2.1928 ± 0.0001 s + 2.5843 ± 0.0001 s - 2.5071 ± 0.0001 s + 3.0876 ± 0.0001 s - 3.0298 ± 0.0001 s + 2.6689 ± 0.0001 s - 2.627.45 ± 0.0001 s) / 5 = 0.03982 ± 0.0002 s


Now because the graph was in a shape of a triangle i could use the formula for the area of a triangle to calculate impulse


J50 = At = ½ (bΔthF) = ½ * (0.03982 ± 0.0002 s * 27.4 ± 1 N ) =  0.545534 NS


%uncertainty(J50) = (± 0.0002 s / 0.03982 s + ± 1 N / 27.4) * 100 = 4.15%




Now that I know what the change in momentum is, what mass carries this mass out, the mass flow rate.


ṁ = Δm/Δt


I dont have the mass of the air, but from my previous research i can figure out the density of air 


N = m/Mr
ρ = m / V
PV = nRT = mRT / Mr, P = ρ*RT / Mr, ρ = PMr / RT 


ρatm = 1.016E+05 ± 0.4% pa * 0.0290 / (8.31 J/mol⋅K * 296.3 ± 0. 1 K) =  1.195 kg m⁻³


I also researched what density air should be at 23 C and standard pressure. I was unable to find data specific for 23.2 C and my specific pressure. But for 23 c and standard pressure Were ρ = 1.289 kg/m³, so my calculation was probably not far off. 


ρ50 = 8.737E+05 ± 2.77% pa * 0.0290 / (8.31 J/mol⋅K * 296.3 ± 0. 1 K) =  10.29 kg/m³


mi = 1.195 kg m⁻³ * 0.000250 ± 0.000001 m⁻³ = 0.0002988 kg


m50  =  10.29 kg m⁻³ * 0.000250 ± 0.000001 =  0.002571 kg


ṁ50 = Δm/Δt = (0.002571 kg - 0.00029875 kg) / 0.03982 s = 0.05702 kgs⁻


And because i only consider the change in mass and temp is constant i don't need to consider its uncertainty


%uncertainty(m˙50) = 3.08% + 0.4% +  ± 2 ml / 250 ml * 100 = 4.28%




With the mass flow rate we can finally calculate the efficiency of the rocket dependent on the pressure, the specific impulse.


Isp = F / (ṁ × g)


This required the average force, for a triangle


Favg = Havg = 2A / Base(ΔT)


And i researched the gravitational acceleration of my location


Isp50 = 2 * J50 / ( Δt * ṁ50 * 9.81833) = 2 * 0.71 / (0.03982 * 0.05702 * 9.81833) = 48.94323679 seconds


%uncertainty(Isp50) = 4.56% * 2 + ± 0.0002 s / 0.03982 + 4.28% = 13.09%

6.3. Graphs


  

I included this graph to show that the correlation is the same between any of my independent variables and the number of pumps, but I think for visualization purposes having a more universal reference like pressure is better.
  
  
  



7. Data Analysis


7.1. Processing the Data


I had an incredible increase and range in pressure which I didn't actually expect, reaching all the way to more than 8 times atmospheric pressure. It would seem that one expects this to have a significant impact on performance. Then unfortunately there seems to be an outlier 30 pump measuring point, which is constantly deviating from the other expected values. 


I think this might be because after finding leaks in my palimetery i added more o rings to seal the chamber, it could be that even those rings did not seal the chamber correctly after pressures exceeded the pressure at 30 pumps reducing the actual pressure in the chamber than what i calculated due to leaks, for the following measurements. But I did not witness any signs of leaks when conducting my experiment.


7.2. Interpretation of Graphs


From looking at the graphs it is obvious that an increase in pressure very much increases impulse very directly, with a strong correlation, both against number of pumps and pressure. But the correlation between pressure and mass flow rate is almost as strong, but the angle of the line is less steep, this is probably because the nozzle throat does not limit the amount of mass that can exist at a time, which means the time which it takes for the mass to flow out is longer because there is more air particles in the rocket and therefore mass flow is strongly affected. And because the mass flow rate seems to be affected in this way the higher force measured gets cancelled out in the formula for specific impulse where we divide by the mass flow rate. In turn the higher force gets divided by a higher mass flow rate dampening the change, due to pressure.


Which is actually interesting to find out as well, I did not consider that both changes can cancel each other out leading to almost no visible correlation between pressure and specific impulse.


Although it has to be said that the uncertainty of 25% could also mean that the correlation might not be visible even though there may actually be one.




8. Evaluation


8.1. Strengths and Weaknesses


I think my experiment overall was not too bad, I did not go into this experiment expecting a crazy correlation so I am very happy with my findings. Apart from my force uncertainties which i was unable to impact as i had one force plate as an option only, i think that especially my uncertainties which i made sure to keep low after preliminary testing were very strong. 


A big weakness though was probably the noise and inconsistency of my readings. The force plate was constantly measuring force changes, only + or - 1 N, even if nothing was happening, this created some noise in my data which was hard to account for, and possibly my data would have been different. Also the inconsistency of my force and time measurements were not good, the spread across my measurements were too big for my likings.


Even Though i very much enjoyed calculating surrounding variables like the pressures and the density of air, I think there might be better solutions possible. But actually it doesn't matter what the actual values are for this experiment as I am only investigating the correlation, and that would stay the same no matter if the values were wrong.


8.2. Sources of Error
A big source of my force readings will likely be that the force plate used was designed for far bigger forces which affect its accuracy and the accuracy of my measurements in the experiment.
Not having equipment that can measure ambient pressure or that can take tests on the surrounding air, might have caused any wrong calculations due to researched values.
8.3. Improvements
Next time I would possibly look into using a scale as a force plate instead, which often goes to 0.001 grammys significant figures, far more accurate then the force plate, and then accounting for gravity to calculate the forces. This could decrease the %uncertainty and reduce the inconsistency of measurements.
Getting access to measurement equipment which can measure more atmosphere specific things similar to once used in weather stations could have a huge impact on the relevance of my measurements to the surroundings of my experiment.
After digging even deeper I found that the mass flow rate is changing differently in proportion to pressure after the gases reach mach 1 in the engine, because of the shock created in the nozzle limiting the mass flow rate completely, choking it, any further increase in pressure does not contribute to increase in mass flow rate. It is very possible that my experiment never choked at the nozzle, which means that there is a possibility for a stronger correlation from pressure to specific impulse at even higher pressures. So for future experiments, investigating how specific impulse is affected by pressure at high speed nozzles like the bell nozzle can be interesting as well, or at even higher pressures like my references like 100 bar.
Also using a proper converging diverging nozzle could lead to higher exhaust speeds, instead of just using a small hole. I have not listed this in sources of error, because the measurements would not be affected, the nozzle is constant throughout the measurements. But higher exhaust speed can contribute to the choked nozzle, giving the same possibility for a higher correlation between pressure and specific impulse.
Considering that one of my errors might be caused due to leaks as mentioned as a outlier. in the future, I would like to experiment with a correctly sealed real rocket engine, assuming that this can survive even higher pressures and does not leak.
9. Conclusion
In conclusion the chamber pressure of a rocket will have some impact on the specific impulse, and being able to reach higher pressures inside a rocket can be beneficial, as long as it is safe. But there might be other variables to look into which affect specific impulse more strongly.
From this research I will be able to use my understanding to go out and design my rocket engine to be able to withstand higher pressures, although all pressures used in this experiment were only close to  8 bars I am looking forward to predicting even higher specific impulse in my rocket at 100-200 bars.
